# bamboo-maven-pom-extractor-plugin

Upgraded version of the `bamboo-maven-pom-extractor-plugin` plugin to support Bamboo 10.x versions. Full credit to the original developer, I have migrated this as a personal project and sharing so others can benefit from it.

Also moving this code from original location https://bitbucket.org/dehringer/bamboo-maven-pom-extractor-plugin to Github for better accessibility and maintenance.

1. Removed Deprecated APIs
2. Updated Dependencies
   - Java 17
   - Bamboo SDK 10.2.0
   - Standard Java collections instead of Guava etc.
